# Advent-of-Code-2022
My approach to and solution of the small programming puzzles for the advent calendar "[Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)" implemented in Visual Studio 2022 and Clang LLVM C++20 standard.

All warnings enabled and with the following GCC/Clang compilation flags -Wpedantic -Wshadow -Weverything. For C++20 ignoring "-Wc++98-compat" is enabled.

#### Disclaimer
I am by no means an expert, so the code should be taken with a grain of salt.
